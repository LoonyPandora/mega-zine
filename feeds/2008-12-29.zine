Reindeer is good barbecued. Now for a song, "Bow down, bow down, before the power of Princess Psycho or be crushed, be crushed, by... her jolly steel toe capped boots of doom!" AHHHH! The flesh-eating demon squid has escaped again and created an army of cyborg zombie soldiers to do its evil bidding! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /><br />

I learned the Spanish national anthem has no words. That sounds disappointing. One of the fun things about watching football is watching players mime to their anthem, hoping no one will notice they don't know many of the words. I don't know how Spanish people can sing this album, I guess they must just hum.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Juicy Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]The Spanish 1968 Eurovision entry wasn't exactly a lyrical masterpiece either.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

It was a glowstick. This isn't funny but I don't want WLW to hurt me for not sending enough letters.

Long overseen by a confusing splat in the Davord Dynasty, asserted independence by sinking land into the ITV channel. Zinians are a flamboyant but estranged people, their primary export garbage. They communicate in incomprehensible howlings and worship a giraffe god. Despite occasional civil war, biscuit scandal they seem prosperous. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
