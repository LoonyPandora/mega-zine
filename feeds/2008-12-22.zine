And Hogmanay. And Hanukkah (from sunset Dec 21 to sunset Dec 29). My favourite, Saturnalia, begins always on Dec 17 and ends whenever in January that you return to your senses (and your home if you can remember where it is). Respect and good wishes to all, whatever your beliefs. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo (Promotional Consideration Furnished By The Beach Bar)[/i][/color]<br /><br />

Then I discovered Schadenfreude Bluegrass.|I don't understand secret questions on e-mail accounts. Anyone with enough malice could discover your mother's maiden name, first school, which blues-rock ensemble once slept on your floor or the first German punkrock single you recorded. How can they be the last line of defence for one's internet privacy? Also, what was your first pet called?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]In my defence, that first German punkrock single was also my last.

Now, where&#39;s that mouthwash?|As a shop worker fed up with changing what's on offer, I suggest we get rid of seasonal nonsense and have one long festival from September to April. Chreasterween will feature the best part of all celebrations - confectionery. Look out for choc reindeer eggs, pumpkin Santas and jelly witches in bunny suits soon.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Great idea! Except, the reindeer thing.
