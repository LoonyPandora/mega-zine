If the Teletext t-shirt doesn't cause people to say "Egads - YOU'RE paddy Irishman!?" Then I may just have to leave up posters advertising for new "chums". It's proven dangerous option before, but this time I'll avoid toilet doors.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]If anyone sees a medium-sized boy in a red Teletext T, hug him will you?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I mean the one where the voiceover bloke says that sharing is bad. What kind of message does that give to the yoof of today?<br />I once shared an apple with Herman the tortoise and it was lovely. I think that sharing is good and lovely and people should be generous and not greedily mean.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Smashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Unscrupulous advertising?

Keep going... all the way down the end.|I came up with a new computer game - Guitar Duty: World Tour At War. In it, you're a guitar-wielding soldier, who plays rock tracks to boost the morale of your squad so they can do conventional war-things, like shooting, and getting hunted by a Predator. Mark my words, it's going to be the greatest game in history (plasticised model of Robin Williams to be sold separately).<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Menome[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]GameCentral's at the end of the hall.

Choose your road carefully, for there are few paths off whichever road you choose. Unless of course, you buy a Land Rover." Sneaky old man. Turned out he was a car salesman. I did buy one. Crashed it into the tree of life and killed a rabbit. Damn irony! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]That's just what I said when I heard Alanis Morrisette for the first time.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
