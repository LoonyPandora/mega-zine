We lack the popular TV shows of Strictly Self-Flatulation and Sorry I Lost My Oyster Card that attract huge audiences in the UK, so we make do with Teletext. Life without you will be hard but I heard they're making a Belgian X-Factor so perhaps it won't be too hard. <br />PS Are you and Bamber dating?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Belle Jinwaffles[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I'm not at rock bottom just yet.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

A new J**** C*** factory wants a taster.<br />But seriously, the loss of 'Zine is sad. The smell of your hoofs in the morning, the matted coat and blue tongue disease will all be sorely missed.<br />I'm sure I don't speak for myself...

My house is falling down, my dissertation needs writing, there are constant roadworks outside the aforementioned house (honestly, WHEN did you see roadmen working at 8am on a Sunday?), and now you've just popped round for tea?
