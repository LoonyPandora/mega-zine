Still, I suppose the Greek police didn't see that cunning escape plan coming. There is always next time. Well here's a picture of the snowman I made, thought it might amuse you.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Opens photo attachment*[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Blushes*[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Develops carrot envy*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I have already offed the likes of Digitiser by writing in a few weeks before it stopped, and now, if rumours are true, I may have done the same to Mega-Zine. In this climate, you can't risk having a non-professional in your office closing down pages, and I feel I'd do well at removing Have Your Say, the horoscopes, and horse-racing news.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Menome[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Want Bamber Boozler's address?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

They are merely, um, tokens of my love and appreciation.<br />Also, I was pleased to see Lionel Richie on the Brits the other day. I'm proud that I once started a Lionel Richie 'Zine cult in 2008.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Squashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Scoffs caramel Freddo*[/b][/color]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

But the blindingly obvious Brokeback had not crossed my mind. Appropriate and very funny! Er, in a melancholy way, of course.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]WLW: Stating the bleedingly obvious since 1993.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
