She brought an illegal immigrant into Mondo Mansion. A mouse! They might be lovely cuddly tiny things but they frighten the servants. Any advice, WLW, you being an animal thingy (though far removed from pestilent mus musculus)? Hang on. She just ate it.[color=#ff0000][i] Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]At least it wasn't rattus rattus - good things come in mice packages![/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

As a veggie, grannies and worms are off the menu - even gummy ones.|Did you hear that, Ziners? No, little gummy worm. I don't know where your grandmother is. Yes, I'm sure that she is in Heaven or wherever it is that good gummy worms go. (I think Wormy's grandmother might be in someone's tummy. But I'm keeping that to myself.)
