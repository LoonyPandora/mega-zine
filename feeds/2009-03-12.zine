See you on the other side!|Why I don't like being a psychic. 1) A client forgot to pay after I helped him be with his loved one (killed him). 2) I keep bending my spoons. 3) When I read people's thoughts their handwriting is terrible. 4) My feet are itchy. 5) None of the ghosts I talk to believe I'm a medium. 6) I got Ouija-bored, leant back on my chair and fell into the volcano. So I'm dead. Bye!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Rose Timp[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Godspeed Ms Timp. See you on the other side![/b][/color]<br /><br />

When push comes to shove, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, but we all know you've been deep-sixed. It's always darkest before the dawn but look on the bright side before you go belly-up: every cloud has a silver lining. It ain't over till the fat lady sings so let's make a last-ditch effort and go out in a blaze of glory... <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Cliches?

Yet.|Anyone ever played a game in a library where you change the covers of books? It confuses people as they pick up the wrong book. It's fun! It's not fun when it happens to you. Until the films came out, I thought Lord Of The Rings was a passionate love story between a stable boy and a posh woman who liked to play rough in the barn. Needless to say I was disappointed when I saw the films. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman (27/04/05 - Whatever Date This Is Printed)[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]12/03/09.
