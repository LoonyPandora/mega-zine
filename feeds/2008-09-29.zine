Months ago, experts told us not to panic or we'd be in a recession. But since they said recession, we panicked. Not me though. I had a Cheerio in my ear that day and thought they said "Don't picnic!". I still did though.

I don&#39;t even have toenails.|I realised I e-mailed myself, instead of you. So, I do wonder if we happen to be the same and I momentarily forgot. Do you have problems associating with other people? Do you constantly paint your toenails all the colours of the rainbow? Do you wish you could go around handing out money to the poor and needy?
