Or was.|I've noticed since moving to Edinburgh that many pedestrians - up to 20 at once in my experience - are content to wait at road crossings without pressing the button. If I join their ilk, I do the sensible thing and press the button, and we're crossed within half a minute. But they sometimes punch me. Maybe they're just embarrassed. Or maybe it's because I shout expletives directly into their ears. Who knows?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]The button system is a secret.

I swear!|Information in the alleged "Doppelganger Affair" has sensationally emerged today showing that the scandal may go to the very top of the cult organisation known as the "'Zine". A spokesperson confirmed that printed evidence existed implying that the mysterious Mable or Mabel is a clone of the other. We go live to Teletext Towers where a statement is expected from their sinister leader, Mr WLW... <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]It was a moment of madness.

My every waking second is a misery for I am worried it will be revealed. If someone even utters the word in a sentence I scream and run away. So now I must reveal the secret, to stop the pain.

Yet every year a big fat bloke with a beard wearing a red suit enters loads of houses, eats the mince pies, drinks the brandy and whisky and not one word is uttered about it!
