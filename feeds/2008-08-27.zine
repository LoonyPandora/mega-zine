I'm getting softer in my old age as I just said sweet and didn't refer to cookies or candy-bracelets or cake. Remember candy-bracelets? Dolly beads we called them. No idea why. We fired them at each other from across the playground. Then they got banned cause some idiot got one in his eye. He got an eye patch for a while which made him look like a pirate so all was right with the world.
