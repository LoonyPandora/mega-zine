You can come back as anything! Your afterlife is like a Kinder Surprise. You don't know what's going to come out of that little orange box (I'm assuming I'll have an orange coffin). It could be cool like a dinosaur or a falcon or or even an evil overlord! But there's always a ying to the yang... you could come back as a descendant of Mondo.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]OWA - Now With Added Mafia Henchmen[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]'Ziners can be so cruel.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Luckily what the Little Chef lacked in stature he more than made for with tenacity, and bit Heston's ankles till he gave in. He made him eat peppered bananas for tea, and Heston cried. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Stouffer[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]What the 'Zine needs is more blue sky thinking![/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
