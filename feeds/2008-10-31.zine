I decided to have my very own ghost watch last year. It was OK, but I could only tell the time after midnight, when there was a full moon - and even then it kept creeping up on me and going "WHOOOOOoooo". So, I was forced to go back to my zombie cuckoo clock.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Undead Stouffer[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Does it go back four seconds when they're hungry?[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Here I am once more, dressed as Shaznay Lewis, bobbing for Appleton sisters in the bargain buckets of musical travesty. Oh, and Yvette Fielding is crying. Karl and Stuart bravely wrestle mild breezes in secret locations. It's all scary stuff. There's pumpkin pie in my stomach. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Dissimulation[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]If name-dropping were an art, you'd be less Damien Hirst and more Rolf Harris.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

In Norway, we have traditional Viking dishes - Rakorret, Gravlaks, Lutefisk and Myrmelk for the trick or treaters. If that doesn't work, we dress up as Icelandic bankers and blood eagle some stockbrokers. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Viking Horde[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]And who says the 'Zine's not topical?[/b][/color]<br /><br />
