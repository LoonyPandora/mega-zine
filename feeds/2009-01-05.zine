Or maybe there&#39;s no need to get so wound up about it?|Looking at my watch, I noticed that the minute hand keeps chasing the hour hand. It's so unfair. It's bigger and faster than the hour hand. The second hand just keeps saying "I'll be there in a minute!" but then just walks on by. But I'm not going to let this keep happening, oh no... not on my watch.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Someone's in line for a right ticking off.

I've been cutting up the headlines to make my own, or sometimes to make ransom notes for when I kidnap people. I must warn you, though, it's a slippery slope - I almost read some of it. *shudder!*<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Rose Timp[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Cashes in Daily Mail Group pay cheque*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

You move your trolley to the left, then to the right and there's still no way past. They have all week to do their shopping and still pick a Saturday. GRANNIES AND GRANDADS GET OUT THE WAY! Why do trolleys not have horns? Grab a granny, I'm proposing an OAP amnesty and plan to dump them all in Port Talbot.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Junior Minister[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Think of it as OAP Frogger - makes things much more fun.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I wouldn't normally watch Big Brother, I just happen to be in the room while my bird watches it. I don't like such childish rubbish. Hopefully she'll go to bed soon so I can play PlayStation.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Psychedelic Gloom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]La Toya 2 win![/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
