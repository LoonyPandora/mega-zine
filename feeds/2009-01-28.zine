I tried making pancakes yesterday, but when I went to flip them, they went out of the frying pan and into the fire. Typical! <br /><br /> Also, whilst spelling the word "typical" in this letter, I accidently hit the "o" key instead of "i". Damn typo! Typical! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Hit and miss. Literally.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I don't want my own one hour TV special. All I want is to have a biscuit named after me. Garibaldi got one. The Bourbon family got one. Eastender's Kat Slater got the Kit-Kat named after her. Why not me? I think it should be something with hazelnuts in it. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Stouffer[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]A Kit Kat is a biscuit?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

MegaVideo and Maxims Club in Newcastle-under-Lyme, both represented by a giant "M" logo, use "I'm watching it" and "You're loving it", respectively, but without any respect. There's also Nestle Breakaway's "One is never enough!", flaunting the weird little bar's insufficiency. We can do better than that. For example...
