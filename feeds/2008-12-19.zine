If I was starting out today, I would have chosen a different name so non-Radiohead fans do not keep asking me if I am made out of Marmite. Next in my Teletext career - guest editor of Love Stars. Keep a look out...<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Pablo Marmite[/i][/color]<br /><br />

Wait, is that libel?|When I was little, my parents used to get Santa and Satan mixed up, which was a bit weird and disappointing. Instead of singing carols, we used to sing Black Sabbath songs. And instead of leaving out mince pies, we used to leave out goats and blood. Fortunately, they eventually realised the difference and Christmas was better after that. I'm still scared of Santa, though.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Smashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Who's to say Ozzy Osbourne isn't actually Santa?

Ma-ti runs a toxic waste dump now.|So scary: ice is melting; polar bears and penguins are in trouble; millions of people will be homeless; Ben And Jerry's opinions on climate change is trusted more than newspapers. How did we let it happen? Is the Earth irreversibly ruined? But one question screams out loudest: Captain Planet, where are you when we need you most?!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Miss Whiskers[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]The Planeteers fell out over royalties, apparently.

Argh, my poor brain.|Hello to you, my question is a question which I doubt that anyone in the world has ever asked you in life up until this point. I would like to know if you like Marmite, and if so would you ever lick it from the body of Joan Rivers?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Lilac Leopard[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Yes, I do indeed love Marmite.

Shame you can&#39;t make a castle out of yeast-extract.|Must be hard being loved by some but hated by others. I've never tried you, although I did like those Marmite Mini Cheddars they used to make. What happened to those? What variety are you? The standard stuff, or squeezy? Or maybe you're full of Guinness or champagne (it is nearly Christmas)? And how's your arch-nemesis, Pedro Bovril?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Pedro was last seen plotting in his ox-bone castle.
