The doctor says: "I bet that's annoying!" The man says: "Of course it is, it's really painful! Are you a real doctor?" The doctor then looks deflated that his attempt at humour failed, but helps the man. The man's health quickly turned a corner.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]All signs indicated he'd go right eventually...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

It was terrible - 14 farmers killed and 20,000 Christmas dinners ruined because lots of turkeys plotted together and rose up against all their farmers and fates. They were merciless as they tried to be free. Please remember all the people who ate beef in 1998 when you eat your yummy turkey on Christmas Day. Never forget!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Little Blue Fox[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I hear some of them are still in hiding on the Costa Del Sol.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

My feet are literally stuck to the floor, and so on. Naturally, there are funnier examples. However I do implore you all to sign the "Literally Petition" against misuse of this word. It is as bad as abusing children and animals. Anyone who commits this crime will be punished by having their head literally chopped off. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Elden Ray[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I'm literally signing up right now.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
