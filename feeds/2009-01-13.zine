The writing across the back libels wildly about the wearer's sexuality. It's sad when I sit alone in the clubhouse nursing half a shandy, with only a surplus of beige jackets for company.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Silent Majority[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Answers on the back of a postcard...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

When we walked in, we saw two policemen in the corner cowering in fear, while the other 18 of the policemen's heads were spinning round and speaking in tongues. I guess possession is 9/10ths of the law. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]All that was missing was a reference to Japan.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
