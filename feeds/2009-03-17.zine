I shall drink some champoo and port in her honour, and indulge in my customary flirtation with Twiglets and soft porn.

No longer will you grace our, Teletext machine. No more will you have to, put up with our demands. It's sea and sun and J**** C****, along the golden sands. Alas, we shall all miss you, and equally, each other.

I will miss you all, especially WLW. I just got a message from Future Me claiming that I would be on a spaceship headed for the sun and die then-ish. I'll take this chance to say goodbye: you've been great, so long and thanks for the fish. Hmm, space travel is cheap so I might book a trip.<br />Can't forget to pack Guess Who though.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Griffplar Of Doom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Professor Plum, in the library, with a dagger.

I&#39;m there.|I give Mega-Zine two years before it returns, seeing as comebacks are all the rage these days. Wacko Jacko is returning and Rocky Balboa didn't let being old stop him from giving one of today's whippersnappers a pounding. However, a WLW comeback would blow both of these out of the water. After all, they have nothing on a gay giraffe (if my prediction doesn't come true, I'll hold Myleene Klass responsible).<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Sonic Goof (Vaseline Vic's No. 1 Fan)[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]A 50-night stand in 2011?

I should've been honoured to have a whole 'Zine devoted to me but I was quite upset.

This old gaff was a hoot, sometimes maybe not; but if you ever said you hated it, you deserved to get shot. I can't believe this place has finally met its end, this place where I've made so many friends. My heart now, it really aches, I just want to comfort eat some J****... C****?
