It is so awkward. "Oh Becky, you're so pretty! Please do you want to go to the prom? It would be awesome!" No, Freckles, I don't. They are so selfish! And how come everyone says young people are so shallow, vapid and transitory? I do not understand! I do not understand geography and maths too. It makes me more adorable!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Little Becky Bigmouth[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Please, someone send her dictionary so she can look up "adorable".[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I had visions of a giraffe scarpering in high heels, silently shrieking, before they changed it to rhinos. A lucky escape there, WLW! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Barking Tree[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I'll tell you one thing - that CJ really gets my goat.[/b][/color]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />
