She's not at fault for fuel costs and the economy receding. Or the existence of the word [a very long, Teletext-unfriendly word - WLW]. Or people inexplicably buying Katy Perry music. All she's to blame for is beautiful sonatas, rocketing sales of M&amp;S lingerie, and limitless puns around her surname.

So on Monday I decided to get the battered clown fish with chips. Didn't enjoy it one little bit though because it tasted funny. So imagine my dismay when I ordered the snail and chips the next day.

Yawn! Obviously she has never met my Cat Sweety Pie, who has clocked up three dogs who were never seen again, one of whose head was found three weeks later in Nuneaton. I think she was sending someone a message. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho (With Evil Tortie Clawing Her Legs) [/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]She's still not in Sprinkles' league...[/b][/color]<br /><br />
