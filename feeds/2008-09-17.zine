What happens in Void stays in Void.|I think it remiss of OWA to possibly spend up to &#163;60 on one album (Void 16/9). VV/DD risked life and limb on a charity walk to restore OWA to TWA. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Cake Or Biscuit[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Haven't you heard?

Let&#39;s not forget Bill Medley.|Stouffer, the last time I let it all hang out I got arrested for frightening the horses. The giraffe, however, just blushed coyly and hummed a few bars of Jennifer Warnes' I've Had The Time Of My Life. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Tut tut Mondo.

Anyway, why do Princess Psycho's letters always start with the word "well"? Why not try "Bless my soul!"<br />[color=#ff0000][i]OWA-fan[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I couldn't have chosen a worse day to print your letter.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

JP McQueen: The Musical.|Fortunately I have no wish to get into a bigot's brain at the foreseeable future so I would have no answer for your question, but is that show a musical by any chance? Still my cat has informed me that Giraffe is kosher and she wants a Barbie, you may have touched a nerve there. She read the Art Of War by Sun Tzu. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho [/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Now that's an idea... JP McQueen: The Musical.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

On the &#39;Zine?|I've just witnessed what must be one of the worst castings of all time. It's Billy Murray in the injurylawyers4u insurance company advert. He was the worst bent copper in The Bill (DS Beech) and he was a gangster in EastEnders. I mean, would you buy anything from this man, let alone insurance? Watch out for more episodes. Terms and conditions apply. [color=#ff0000][i]Aphra The Post-modern Spy, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Billy Murray? On the 'Zine?[/b][/color]<br /><br />
