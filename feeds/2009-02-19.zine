In order to test their endurance, I beat them with a lumphammer, drove over them, dropped a cow on them and got Rik Waller to stand on them. The steel-toes are fine. Rest of the boots been destroyed though. I'm not a good driver and Rik Waller was hungry. He didn't go for the cow though. Odd. So very odd.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I'm told Rik has a lovely personality.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
