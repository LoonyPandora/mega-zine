Any erroneous details, in particular the fins, will have you punished. Failure to complete your task after this ghostly second reminder, also so. Rearrange the following: s******** [ouch - WLW], marzipan, painful, push. A clue towards the method with which this will take.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Elden Ray[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Well and truly below the belt Elden.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

After I knocked over a terracotta pot, we both saw a shadowy figure in the corner. "The ghosted is up erect!" shouted Marik. I told him his sentence was grammatically erroneous, but he said it wasn't and I misheard him as he was eating marzipan. I just don't know who to believe. There was no ghost though.

Your belief is erroneous, in fact. You might think the preceding sentence was rubbish. You are right. But I was challenged to send it (or parts of it) and, as it makes more sense than half the 'Zine these days, I thought no one would notice. All the same, I am ashamed for what I've done.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Guessed which words yet?[/b][/color]<br /><br />
