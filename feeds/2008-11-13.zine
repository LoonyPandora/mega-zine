I suspect that Vigilante Malestrom doesn't know that every time you press the button in Edinburgh a puppy dies in a horrible way. Still, with that foul mouth it may explain why he's barred from the Pear Tree (that's a pub across the road from Edinburgh Uni and all the freshers are barred from this year).<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Is there a nice way for a puppy to die?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

A stranger and I were getting on like a house on fire. We collapsed to the ground while smoking. Smoking is a dangerous habit. Like when a nun chucks nunchucks. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Suture self.[/b][/color]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

Luckily, for now at least, I'm perched on the ledge of sanity, but I do still get dizzy spells. There's a bird nearby, that's Empathy, and it's singing a song of courage. And... hey, is that Ziggy Marley? Wow, it is! I'm gonna get his autograph!

A giraffe wash line is not necessarily at conventional height. The officers were distinctly sniffy about the whole thing. What shall I do with them now? Hmm. No... NO! The Judge was adamant, last time; you recall? <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Cake Or Biscuit[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]You're right. You are sick.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
