Printed in full, Randy Omo.|Well, Jamie Swanson (if that IS your real name), I'm fascinated by agranams, especially appropriate ones like The Classroom/Schoolmaster or Old West Action/Clint Eastwood, but there's not a lot you can do with WLW (or so rumour has it). I did a list of 'Ziners anagrams last year but it wasn't printed. Hmm. Thin pies rely on/pithy one-liners. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Who wasn't paying attention? Printed in full, Randy Omo.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

While trying to sort out all my finances he yelled at me for not being organised. Since then, I have started filing everything. He still wasn't happy. Admittedly, I did file everything under E. E stands for both Everything, and Everything Else. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]And Eejit.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

The other carp would ask why he was so reserved, so diffident, but his reticence could never be explained. Throughout life, he was unconfident and thoroughly pusillanimous, forever timid. Despite his bashfulness, he lived as long and as happy a life as a carp can live.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Carp diem, Davis!

She was simply the most adorable evil little thing I'd ever read on a textual service. Also, I keep hearing about a 'vegetable revolution'... are we all going to be eaten by giant carrots? Come back and save us OWA!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Raspberry Heaven (#1 OWA Fan)[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]She's on secondment to the US, slaying short sellers on Wall Street.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

I've no idea who Sot is, what his hole is like or where the entrance is.<br />All I know is that it is somewhere in West Bromwich. It's all very dark and new to me!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Junior Minister[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Oooh Matron![/b][/color]<br /><br />
