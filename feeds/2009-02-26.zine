But not that.|WLW (sobbing between my keys), I can't understand the ending of our 'Zine. Anyway, (wiping my tears) my favourite 'Zine was when I wrote about forming a band with yourself and other 'Zine-ites. You said no to making sweet music with Fluffy The Evil One. How I roared at your reply and how Fluffy wrote in afterwards. Does the offer still stand - no making sweet music with Fluffy?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Qwerty Keyboards Are Out Of Stock?[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Anything could happen over the next three weeks.

Shows what he knows. Reminds me of the clairvoyant in Blackpool whose shop was closed due to unforeseen circumstances.
