Your letters have provided me with paper to burn on the fire. I know you all emailed your letters, but I printed them off as the ink gives the fire a lovely black, yellow, cyan and magenta glow. I like to rhyme so on with the show! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

Squirrels have stolen my fireworks! They will not give them back! I am not sure how it happened! I saw them playing with the sparklers in the trees outside my window, and they let off bangers at 4am. I cannot sleep! I do not know what to do. They have all the rockets. I am scared of squirrels, and fireworks, and squirrels with fireworks.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Little Blue Fox[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I'm also scared of squirrels with fireworks, but for different reasons.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

We have nothing in common.|You share the second, third, fourth, fifth, penultimate and ultimate letters of your name with Daddypoos, Wigan. Also, his preantepenultimate letter is the same as your one-to-the-left-of-forepreantepenultimate letter. More amazing is all words ending with "ultimate" also end with "mate". So we're mates. It must be fate! Without the "f"! With an "m"! At the start!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Rose Timp[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]That's not all me and Daddypoos have in common.

I watch the Irish film Breakfast On Pluto occasionally and I'm sure that Paddy/Kitten just wants to be Cher, to be Cher.

I&#39;m planning an elaborate practical joke.|I usually get great presents from Santa. But he sent a letter saying he can't afford presents due to the credit crunch and can only give me coal and sprouts. But he said I could be one of his elves and deliver Mondo's presents and fan mail. So he gets cool presents and I don't? Hmph! If Santa thinks a couple of candy canes is going to make up for *that*, he is very mistaken.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Aphra The Post-modern Spy[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Can I have the sprouts and mail?
