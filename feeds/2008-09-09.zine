Would anyone care to explain to me exactly how he was conceived?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Arrant Nerd Boxes Yodeller[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]With great difficulty, I'd imagine.

So I'll just eat sprouts then, you think that'll work?<br /><br /> You're exempt, WLW, being a tree munching veggie. I blame the elephants. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Barking Tree[/i][/color]<br /><br /> <br />[color=#0000ff][b]You heard it here first: don't eat giraffes.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Man, don&#39;t we know it...|I don't want to be the weirdo at university/ Being the weirdo back home is weird enough for me. I must hide away my weird, and to this I must vow/ As I don't want to be estranged/ I'm strange enough right now.
