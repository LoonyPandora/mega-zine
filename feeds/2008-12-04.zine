Besides, Mondo is old enough to be Elden's great-grandfather. If Mondo is going to lurve anyone from 'Zine, I think he is more suited to Daddypoos.<br />Also, what happened to your uit?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Juicy Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]So, when do we get to the "Goodwill to all men" part?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Last time I called her PP she sent round the Viking Hordes. They dissed the three piece suite, the carpet and the fridge-freezer. Once they got indoors however, they were fine. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]If I remember correctly, wasn't it "Pee Pee", not "PP"?
