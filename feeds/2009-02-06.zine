They were connected up to comatose people called "texters" who lay in baths of tomato and/or mushroom soup similar to those in Twelve Monkeys, Doctor Who, Matrix, certain Philip K Dick books and Cylon Resurrection ships. Also, I would like to swap medication with Gross Girl so I can imagine that I rock.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Doubles Mondo's dosage*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

However, I do know two people who are called Alice. I don't know what horrified me the most: the fact that Daddypoos tried to be funny but wasn't at all, or the fact that he had the impudence to mention the name Alice in his very daft letter.

I've tried really hard to get her to wear human clothes, but she's refusing. How can I make her see that if she would only adopt a pair of bootleg jeans and a hoody top she could look 10 months younger? And she will not accessorise. It's as if she has no idea what I'm talking about. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Stouffer[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]She'll get nowhere unless she gives up that 40-a-day habit.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

He is so hot! And wicked. He could play with my slide-whistle anytime, if you know what I mean... No one who speaks German could be a bad boyfriend.
