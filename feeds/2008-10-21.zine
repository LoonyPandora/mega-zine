Firstly, none of them are blonde and I don't think "nubile" describes 6'4" to 6'10" guys who like nothing better than terrorising people on the beach with Minis, tossing chavs off cliffs and singing that song about Goblins. Now, as for blood eagling Mondo, we need him for the pub quiz. That, and he will cry if they did it.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Mondo rushes out to buy shell suit and climbing boots*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

At last month's Tall Ships Regatta in Kernow you could've had hands-on experience of young, fit foreign seafarers and enjoyed the social benefits of a night or three at Mondo Mansion. Falmouth is a great place for a culturally beneficial night out. If you get my drift. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo [/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Right, all round to Mondo's - I'll bring the Dirty Dancing DVD.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
