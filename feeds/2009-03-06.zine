I didn't think so either. <br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]You're just trying to wind us up.[/b][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#ff0000][i]BlackDove [/i][/color]So this is (nearly) the end. I do not want to sound like a fruit dog but I will miss wasting my credit to only get on about one in four times. <br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It all goes to the WLW Retirement Fund.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I guess I find it cheesily addictive. What I can't understand is, why is Quincy such a lurve god? He's about 63 or something but, all his love interests seem about half his age (at least). Maybe we're expected to think that Medical Examiners are babe magnets. I don't know, it all seems highly illogical.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Aphra The Post-modern Spy, Hector's House [/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Daytime TV - soon my only friend...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I may only be a small girl with too much free time but I can do a lot of damage with a pointy stick and can cry on cue. Please remember this when you review your decision: do you really want to be blamed for not only extensive damage but also making a small girl cry? Love, huggles and revolutions.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]One Winged Angel (Marmaduke gets extra hugs)[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]If giraffe tears won't shift them, nothing will.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Is it real or is it an early April Fool joke? And how can you sun your butt in Gran Can knowing the 'Ziners are in the wilderness? If there is a leaving party I shall dress up as a J**** C*** and shout political slogans. It worked in Vietnam before they were shot. I would like to leave a list of favourite 'Ziners. I would like to, but I won't.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Daddypoos, Wigan (Vive Le France)[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I think you just did.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

A fan of 'Zine since I was about 11 (I'm 24 now), I was hoping my kids would read this, and my kids' kids, and my kids' kids' kids... well yeah, you get the idea! Farewell 'Zine, with acid rain, decapitated chavs and beautiful violence, ITV will never hold the same attraction. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mama Goth[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Even I couldn't repeat the same jokes for that many years.[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Actually...[/b][/color]<br /><br />
