So, I have decided to replace my windscreen with a two-way mirror. Think about it! Other people driving along, thinking "Is that Colonial Foot Soldier? Oh wait, it's me... huh?" I see no faults in my plan. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Careful - Tim Westwood trawls these pages for ideas.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I must say their breakdancing rendition to T-Quest's I.L.O.V.E.T.E.K.N.O. was amazing, in spite of the chaos I got embroiled in after (I admit my name is similar to Princess Psycho's). All I'm saying is, Lloyd Webber's got a heck of a task on his hands this year.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Psychic Potato[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It'll be his piece de resistance - singing EVAs on rollerskates.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
