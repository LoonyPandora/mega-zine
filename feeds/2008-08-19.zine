Jeez, how does a play on words have anything to do with a yoghurt allergy? Thank God I'm an atheist. Now I need a tab *oops* I mean a fag *oops* sorry, a ciggy. Can I say Howay my 'andsome, or would that be miscegenation? <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]That's a filthy habit you've got there Mondo.

But they don't have Hello Kitty light sabres and blueberry muffins, which is a major downside.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I can't wait for the bit when it turns out Mondo is your father.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

It needs fresh blood to get the heart pumping and the juices flowing (oh, crikey!). It's a sticky job and not for the faint-hearted, but I don't mind getting my paws dirty. I need something to get my teeth into now that the price of lamb has gone way beyond my grasp (although I'm unavailable on the 18th -it's a full moon). Before you ask, YES, I do bite... but only in Welsh.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]SheWolf [/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]What a howler...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

And believe me, then and now you still aren't great. I thought things are supposed to mature with age, like a fine wine or cheese. Clearly you missed the memo but got the maggots.
