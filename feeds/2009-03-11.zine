But the digital revival started me off again, and in two years I've sent a further, hang on, let me count... 149. Blast. Another week and I might have made 150. This is definitely my last one, so 149 it is. I hope at least a few have been worth reading. Thank you for the happy times, 'Ziners one and all, and cheers, WLW - see you on VR! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Thnks fr th mmrs Nsn Jm Sw.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I think we should have a film party. I was mulling about a 'Star Wars Meets The Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Star Wars with alcohol'. And, for Mondo, Santa Claus meets The Ice Cream Bunny without alcohol'. Does that sound like a good idea?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]A little gold paint and he would've made a perfect C3PO...[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Here's some motivational speeches I've memorised for an occasion like this. Ahem: <br />"Strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can ever imagine". <br />"Hasta la Vista, Baby" in conjunction with "I'll be back". <br />"Tonight we dine in hell". <br />And don't mess up the place after you leave, I'll probably have to clean up. That's not a speech, it's a warning!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Janitor[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Mr Motivator you ain't.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
