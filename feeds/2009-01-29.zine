"Is a Kit Kat a biscuit?" you ask. The wafer says yes, but the chocolate says no. I might have one with a cuppa... so biscuit. But also at the end of my lunch... so chocolate bar. They are in the biscuit aisle of the supermarket, but by the till in a confectioners. Please help. I'm going to need a J*'*** C*** to calm my nerves... UH-OH, here we go again. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Stouffer[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]We're partying like it's 1999![/b][/color]<br /><br />

He gave me a handful and said "Stick that up your pipe and smoke it!". So I did. I'm quitting though. Awful habit. Sorry, I got distracted there by a badly dressed nun.

I forgot my bike lock, so I had to recycle there. It was just-about rubbish; the lecturer kept trash-talking me, and my concentration went to waste. This girl wanted to copy my notes, but I refuse'd to litt'er. We almost had a scrap, until I agreed to be merciful an dfill in her notebook.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]You wheelie bin working hard on that one, haven't you?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I'd like to say this is completely false, as I am not covered in pastry, with gravy surrounding me.
