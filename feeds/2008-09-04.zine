Afterwards, while looking at my mug in the mirror, I became angry and my mug turned red. I went out and searched for the mugger who mugged me. I managed to get my mug back but was still so angry that I threw my mug at the muggers' mug. It broke. Buy me a mug WLW! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Sorry, you're not my cup of tea.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

I've noticed a bloke in Sainsbury's who looks like him and someone who looks like him in Tesco. There are two more Darryl lookalikes. I will tell you about them tomorrow.
