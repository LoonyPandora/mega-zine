I couldn't make any sense of it at all, it had absolutely no storyline. And the ending was totally implausible - apparently, the zebra did it.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Bob The Chicken[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Insert canned laughter here*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Then I'm taking my family and friends on a luxury cruise. While I'm away, I'm having my house and garden completely transformed, and I'm paying for it out of the &#163;50m I won yesterday. Then... oops, now I remember, I was playing Monopoly on my mobile. How do I convince my boss the e-mail was a joke?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Jaggy Thistle[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Change all the calendars in the office to April 1.
