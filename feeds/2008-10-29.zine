So quiet. A ghost, silent and invisible. A creek. I pause. I am so close, falling through a void. Moonlight splinters curtains, casting spider shadows and reflecting off the knife. I pause, collecting my thoughts, spectres of uncertainty flick my mind. I reach, slow, silent. The last muffin is mine! Yay! It is very yummy. No-one will ever know. Mwahaha!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Little Wooo000ooo Fox[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Click* Light fills the room, revealing Princess Psycho with katana in hand...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

He held a coat hanger, wandered over to the campers... and stood there. One little boy walked gingerly over to him - for Halloween, he was dressed as Geri Halliwell. The man then raised the hanger, which had loverly marshmallows for the fire. He was their Scout Leader. I should have mentioned that. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irissshhh...is there someone there?man[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Couldn't he have been wearing a hockey mask or something?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

In 50 years, I imagine that they'll all be singing songs by Scooter and Soulja Boy, and wearing tracksuits and hoodies. Most of the old people I know are worried about being possessed by vampires and zombies, which is a bit scary. But not as scary as the old people of the future.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Smashed Strawberry, Hector's House [/i][/color][color=#0000ff][b]*Books tickets to Scooter's 50th Anniversary Reunion Concert*[/b][/color]<br /><br />
