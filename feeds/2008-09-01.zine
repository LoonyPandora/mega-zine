Put it away before you have an eye out.|Of course Gothic Fairy and the Lil' Tooth Fairies from Hellboy are as cute as buttons, still why use them on Newbies who are innocent of the ways of Zine? Instead, use them on obnoxious people like The person who cancelled Invader Zim. It is either that or I get my claw hammer out and do the job.<br />Love, Betrayal and Revenge<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho [/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Arrghh, not the claw hammer.

Daddy Irishman and I decided to test this out. After we got back from t'hospital, where they successfully re-attached two of his fingers, we agreed that it's probably just an old phrase. <br />What happened to his fingers? Mr T ran over them in a tank whilst chasing a guy wearing sandals and socks.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]The pen isn't even mightier than a fjord, I'm afraid.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Now we've global warming, I have to sell my warm clothes at a loss.<br />If we shot all scientists the problem would go away. In fact shoot everyone and leave the world to us loonies.
