Brian De Palma's Phantom... has long been a favourite. I recall a Jessica Harper night at a fantasy convention in Glasgow when they also showed Suspiria and Shock Treatment, the poor sequel to Rocky Horror, in which she played Janet. Movies? Don't get me started. Oh. You did. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Right, who put that mistletoe up there?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I'm so determined not to hear that Slade song I put a glam filter on. Me? A joyless spoilsport? Pah.

Ahem.|Two female rhinoceros (or would you prefer rhinoceri) went to a ball. One sat most of the dances out until a certain rhinoceros asked her to dance. Her friend wanted to know why she was dancing all night with this rhinoceros. All excited she replied, "Don't you know who he is? It's Rhino Neal."<br />Rhino Neal.
