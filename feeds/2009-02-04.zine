The ex-chair of RBS is known as Fred The Shred. That's my nickname, hard won by clawing those who would give me pills and behaving like velcro with carpets, clothes etc. Then there are the missing pieces of bark on certain boughs. Now, I ask you, WLW, could a mere human be so ferocious?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Fred, Lord Poface Of TBT [/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Have you heard the Christian Bale rant?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

They are very disturbed that Mondo likes Tintin. Has he read Tintin In The Congo? It has Tintin blowing up a rhinoceros with a stick of dynamite... which is useful if you want to get rid of rhinos.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]How else are you supposed to blow up a rhinoceros?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I believe you know of me, I'm a Keyboard, (not to point out obvious things) my friends Mousey and CPU were talking about me the other day saying how I've distanced myself from them. I only wanted this new fad by going wireless!
