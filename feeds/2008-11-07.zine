I work in an office. While walking past a workmate I don't shout "We do the same job but we're currently going in opposite directions! What a world!"<br />I will from now on though. Looks like fun. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]If only I went ahead with those "Honk if you're a 'Ziner" stickers...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

If I made you blush then it was elsewhere. Perhaps Nasty in Herts or Ugley? Or Noplace in Co Durham? Only Daddypoos (Hugh Jass) and myself know the truth!
