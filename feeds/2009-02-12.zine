Although it was not entirely a shock he is not in the right frame of mind to organise an update today. MegaZine will next be updated on Friday... maybe.<br /><br /> Name for ship: HMS Pinafore, now that you mention it. Doncha just love a good anagram?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*The Penny drops*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Back To The Future, Doctor Who, Bill &amp; Ted, Hitchhiker's Guide, Majora's Mask and more. I just saved the world from something that would've happened in three days. That makes this letter redundant, as you'll never know what I saved you from, unless something happens to me before I can stop it again. My brain hurts. A 'Ziner was evil and I had to or will have to stop them. Really confusing.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Griffplar Of Doom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Is that you Locke?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

For a moment I thought you were going to use that little dusting of snow as some pathetic excuse, but I now see you had a perfectly legitimate reason for not getting in. Thank goodness you're safe, anyhow. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Fighting Torque[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Yes, sandstorm.[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Yes.[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Hides photos of snowbound frolics*[/b][/color]<br /><br />
