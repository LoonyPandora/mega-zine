I always wondered why I, with my vast video game intellect, could never get into GameCentral. Oh well, if they don't want to hear my gaming gold, it's their loss. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for my dinner guests Princess Peach, Level 72 Mage and Pyramid Head. My butler Roland is making Pocky as we speak (Japan, geddit?). <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Psychic Potato[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Careful - that Peach is a right liability once she's had a couple.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I'm wondering if somewhere in my house is actually part of the Bermuda triangle. I'm leaving land mines out to see if I caught anything.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Turns to look at Geordydebbles accusingly*[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
