Specifically, the Doldrums. Our vessel has come to a standstill. Captain WLW (hello, sailor) is going down(!) with the 'Zine. Will there be a last-minute bail out by the government? I heard from Junior Minister that WLW's getting a knighthood and a massive pension. Sixteen days and counting... *sob*.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo [/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]&#163;500,000 a year isn't that much these days, is it?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Maybe it's something to do with St David's Day. I couldn't find a leek in the fridge, so I've pinned a stick of celery to my lapel. A few people looked at me strangely, so I told them, "I need a leek!". They said, "Go off!" (or words to that effect). I don't think I'll bother with St David's day next year. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Psychedelic Gloom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]The 18th will be the only day of note in March from now on - 'Zine Day.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

The minute I admitted liking a Take That song they split. I used to be the only person in Britain who bought the root beer from McDonald's, and then they stopped selling it. And I only just started to get the nonsense I spout onto the 'Zine and I hear it's on its way out. I'm going to live in a bubble from now on, just in case.

Then it was rebuilt and is now new and shiny. As well as selling M&amp;S stuff, they also have something called the Wild Bean Cafe. OK, so they sell food, but they don't have tables or chairs. So how can it be a cafe? It baffles me.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Juicy Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]And why do they bother putting locks on the doors?[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
