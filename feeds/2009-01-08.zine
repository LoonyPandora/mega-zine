What was all that about?|My new year's resolution turned into a bet, so in desperation I have turned to my fellow 'Ziners. I bet a tuppence I could get onto Heroes (Hiro Nakamura being akin to God on stilts). My plan is to enter myself on X Factor in an attempt to stand out, then slowly meld with Dermot O'Leary. The resulting double-Irish charm would get me my own BBC3 chatshow. The rest explains itself really. Any comments or advice?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Marmaduke Twist[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]So, Volume 3. What was all that about?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Far too greedy in the forehead department.|On Doctor Who And The Last Crusade he mentions "a howling wilderness called The Void." I thought of sending this to them, but erm, sensa yuma/Void. Both appear when you Google oxymoron. Know wha I mean, tall boy? New Who, ooh or boo? <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It's a boo from WLW Towers I'm afraid.
