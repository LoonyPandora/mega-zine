Eventually, I hit it with a hefty rubberballpeen and it corrected itself. Wish I'd thought about it earlier. So, apologies to the editors on the missing days, but for Best Ed, well, I say "jelly", she say "naked". Works for me.

Last time I was here, it was all Spectrum graphics and talk of Brigadiers and evil bunnies. Now it's all flashy and webby, and with my laptop I can take 'Zine wherever I want! It's like stepping out of Tron into the Matrix. But one question remains to our prospective new readers: Will you take the blue pill... or the awesome pill?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Captain C Captains[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Blissful ignorance gets my vote.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

So, naturally, I looked down. Attached to my foot was a tiny glow in the dark foot! I felt proud and walked taller than usual. After all, I had grown three feet!
