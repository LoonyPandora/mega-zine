When the delivery guy arrived with my bespoke pilchard pizza and what I hoped to be afters, I said I'd look silly trying to eat THAT out of a cone for dessert. He said I'd look silly hanging ice cream on the wall. Next time I must remember the difference between Cornetto and Caravaggio.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Psychedelic Gloom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Imagine Mabel's consternation when a Mapplethorpe was delivered with her pancakes...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Thought not.|I went to the Societies Fair at Uni, despite my doctor warning me I'm allergic to things with "soci" in them. It was crowded so I panicked and had to leave. Instead of all of those, I made my own - The SOCIal anxiETY. The funding allows for public demos, big nights out and travel to conventions, but I'll find a loophole somewhere. Last year's convention sucked. Oh, and if anybody else joins I'll leave.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Any takers?
