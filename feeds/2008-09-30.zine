For that reason, I opt to simply deface the area around the stamp, so that the Queen is Rambo or something, or having a staring competition with Pac-man. Or both!<br />Those solicitors are yet to reply.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Who knew the 'Zine was such a hotbed of philately?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I hate drinking lime. Yuck! Lime is disgusting to drink. I swore to myself that I would never ever drink lime. So I had a 7up instead.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]If you're ever in the mood to have your mind blown, ask a Mexican what a lime is.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

It had better be good as I spent all of 15 minutes preparing my ingredients, cooking the pasta and whatnot. I did not lick my fingers. I did not swish my hair, and nor was I naked. I don't think I'd make a TV chef somehow. However, I do think we should do a 'Zine Come Dine With Me. I'd invite the ever-so-scintillating ones and give them salmonella.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Elden Ray With 62 Michelin Stars[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Sounds lovely.

You are too kind. Shall I take a bough? Ha ha ha ha ha! Ahem, I love you too and WLW, of course. You can stop twisting my twigs now, I paid due homage to you, oh tall one. I think Mondo is the bee's knees too, but then he's older than me and I respect my elders.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Barking Tree[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Bee's knees?
