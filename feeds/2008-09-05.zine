I walked over and slowly pulled the handle. All I could see was seven corpuscles of light, 58 signed pictures of Kerry Katona, and the hazard lights from my old car. The funny thing was, I only ever had 43 pictures of Kerry. DUN-DUN-DAAAAAA!!! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Aaarrgh, your Kerry pictures must be breeding, or perhaps being cloned?[/b][/color]<br /><br />

There&#39;s something odd happening here.|The other two Darryl lookalikes work in another Tesco. One of them is a woman. Out of all the people who look like him, she looks the most like him. All this Darrylness is a bit spooky. Maybe there's a secret factory where they are cloned.<br /><br /> [color=#ff0000][i]Squashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It's probably the same place they're cloning Kerry Katona pictures.

I stepped over the foul line and didn't drop the ball in time.<br /><br /> [color=#ff0000][i]Junior Minister[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Strike it off your list of hobbies and pin your hopes on something new.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Vic was having a bit of a paddy(!) one night and threw a mug at the tumble-dryer. The glass door has a hole in it and he had to buy new hinges and door catch. The mug survived intact.<br /><br /> [color=#ff0000][i]Diesel Dick[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Sounds like it was a hole-hearted effort though.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Just as you prepare to call the fire brigade, one jiver breaks his corpuscles. Just as you prepare to call the ambulance, you find out they're all illegal immigrants! And you were supposed to call Mum! You can't handle any more! You can only make one call. Who you gonna call?
