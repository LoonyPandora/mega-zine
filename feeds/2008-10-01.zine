What I recommend to be ultra cute is to have the big toes painted yellow with a ickle smiley face on them. And if The Font Of All Wisdom Mondo says there's seven colours of the rainbow, say "But I'm cute!" and stick your tongue out.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]He's pedantic enough to point out the colours are infinite, it's just that we choose to ascribe seven names to them.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

If her mother is dead (or presumed so), then surely the title of Earl would pass down on the male side? Lara can't inherit the title of Countess Of Abingdon, can she?
