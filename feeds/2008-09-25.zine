Hilarious?|After that shambolic 'Zine, I thought I'd better write something intellectual. Problem is I've been wasting my intellect finding anagrams on the net. Did you know for instance that an anagram of Large Hadron Collider is "Hello! A cladding error"? Or that London Olympic Games is "Oncoming Medals Ploy"?

And secondly, are you fighting FOR or AGAINST white lines?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]FightingTorque[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]1. Normal keyboard.[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]2.
