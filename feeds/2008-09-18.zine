Gets me every time.|Bill Medley... yeah, OK; but Jennifer sang with my lyricist hero Leonard Cohen on wads of albums and he once said "Giraffes are God's visual gifts to mankind", whereas Bill and Bob, Flowerpot Mob, just got Righteous about lonely rivers and Ghost pottery. One must prioritise. Or prioritize (either is acceptable). Love you.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I'll see your Leonard Cohen and raise you a Joe Cocker.

Wait till they get a load of our Lloyd Webber in an unbuttoned white shirt.|Well, it looks like that Cat is now wanting France destroyed after hearing Madame Sarkozy singing. She's been torturing a frog (she's twisted), we have no idea where she got it from. Still now they have judges for next year's Eurovison, the only way Russia will win with a pair of trolls is to nuke most of Europe.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Dima Bilan?

The US has a Bush who likes oil so much he shows mankind how to hate so much. Then in the UK we had Blair, he didn't care, now he thinks he's a saint but I know he ain't. Now we have Brown, who's bringing the UK market down and down and he's in charge, the silly clown.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Ken, SW London[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]The answer is blowing in the wind, man.

That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.|When asked how bad the economy was going to get, a man on TV replied "how long is a piece of string?". String isn't bad but seems to get bad press. String him along, string him up, highly strung... Now, I like string and want it to be known that if I hear any more unfavourable string-based publicity, there WILL be trouble!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]GEeKorUNiquE?[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Klass.
