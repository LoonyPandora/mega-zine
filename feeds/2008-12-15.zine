I know pi to 63 decimal places, I can swim an Olympic pool in one breath, and I'm not afraid of Princess Psycho. But I still think that this is my greatest achievement in life thus far. I hope you all enjoy my edition of the Christmas Takeover as much as I've enjoyed writing it. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]FIGHTING[ ]TORQUE[/i][/color]<br /><br />

Although, if I give to charity, I won't be able to afford the gym or healthy food. Well that decides it, I'll stay at home with my money and do nothing. Happy New Year all!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]You know what they say - doing something pays over time, doing nothing pays immediately.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Sometimes two, if you&#39;re really unfortunate, but just one this time. Thank goodness.|Driving down the road the other day, I noticed Tony Christie on the sidewalk, so I rolled down the window and shouted "Hey Tony! Is this the way to Armadillo?". He shouted back "Amarillo!". So I threw a Dime bar at him.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]There's always one, isn't there.
