Having wondered what I could put in my manifesto, it turned out that Coolio was busy, Roy from Catchphrase had called it a day and that Jimmy Corkhill was filming a Brookside special. Like all politicians, I'll simply leave you with my "jokes", nothing but contempt and less money in your wallet instead. In the meantime, I'll be making a start on Santa's sherry.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Junior Minister[/i][/color]<br /><br />

Wye aye man.|I write for the first time in several hundred years to declare that you should quit your high-powered political career helping people from the Midlands and whatnot and go back to your career as Ant McPartlin. It is only fair, the new robotic version that Dec is presenting with now is not convincing in the slighest nor quite as handsome.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Lilac Leopard[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]I'm not going to change my spots for anyone, except for Geoff from Byker "Toon" Grove.

Magic.|Hey, you're that Ministry of Sound guy, aren't you? I love your stuff.<br />...wait, no, you did that "Move Your Feet"! That was brilliant!<br />I'm glad there are people like you who just want to dance and have fun, not like all these silly political types. They smell. Really bad.
