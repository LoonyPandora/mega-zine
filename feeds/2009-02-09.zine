Right now my career's in ruins (archaeology). I tried air stewardry, but my miming skills were insufficient. I tried tree surgery but fainted at the sight of sap. I tried estate but it was all too real. I tried selling internal organs but my heart wasn't in it. I considered professional tennis but I was only good at serving - does anyone need a butler?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Rose Timp[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Well that's today's pun quota blown.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

What I saw this time, shook me to my very core. I saw a man, who looked exactly like me. But kinda more transparent. He beat me in chess.
