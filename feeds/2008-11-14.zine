So I used my time machine to go back in time and buy me some Doc Marten's. Then I saw myself walking down the road, so left myself a note telling me to buy some boots. Talk about a Predestination Pair o' Docs. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Tsh-dum-b'dum![/b][/color]<br /><br />

Latin in origin meaning thus, or it is so or even not as silly as it seems. Must do better, or report to PP after 'Zine (that'll be two pairs of pink rigger boots). Mondo now seems to be undomiciled. Perhaps he's gone on the run. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Cake Or Biscuit[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]You make me sic. How's that?[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
