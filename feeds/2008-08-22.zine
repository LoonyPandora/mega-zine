Payable to WLW please.|Having discovered the 'Zine via a slip of protocol, the Beach Bar manager now shows it on the big screen. The regulars asked what miscegenation was, I told them that unlike their banjo-playing selves, it's about people who get out more. Mind you, "'ZINE ON THE SCREEN" on the chalk board outside has a certain je ne sais quoi. If they start texting, ohh, lordy... <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]'Zine bar subscriptions are a snip at &#163;13,000 a year.

But that still leaves a few questions: are you going to stay on Teletext? Will we see a return to old school page styles on new digital teletext?

Gone are the days when it was a cuddly, furry, pet-like animal that snuffled about your feet, looking for scraps. Now it's simply offal. Still, it has its uses. Like marrowbone jelly, it's evidently fodder for dogs. Great big bloodhounds with glistening teeth and wet tongues. Pity they're gentle. Could have been useful.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Elden Ray[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Marrowbone jelly on toast - Mabel swears by it.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
