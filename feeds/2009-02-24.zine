Don't deny that was you posing in front of it, trying to look taller. The shoes were a dead giveaway. Still, beats fiddling by the fire any day.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Barking Tree[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]All for charity TBT - Giraffes In Need.[/b][/color][color=#0000ff][b]No one's hiring even-toed ungulates these days...[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Yes.|I texted Void in praise of Vigilante M's hilarious Philosophical Top Ten but they seem to have stopped printing my offerings since I shouted at them for putting my name to something not mine. Can you honestly imagine me writing "Bring back Sheena Easton" to a music forum?! Now, which 'Ziner would be savvy enough to fit me up like that? <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Sheena Easton? No. Sinitta? Yes.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

I went to town earlier, I saw this swarm of pigeons, well it was more like a bunch really. All they kept saying to each other was "cooo". Now that's a conversation isn't it? "Cooo" this "Cooo" that. I did try and give 'em J**** C****. They said: "cooo."<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Qwerty [Birdwatchin'] Keyboards Are Out Of [Cooo]?[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Surely the correct collective noun is a "mess" of pigeons.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I mean, we're here in the credit crunch and it's hard enough to get a job without the added hassle of being a giraffe. I feel for you, honestly. We should make a new 'Zine with jam and fairycakes and pictures of David Tennant. Man, I'd go for that. You know where I am if you think that's a good idea, innit.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Lilac Leopard[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Sends off CV to Springwatch*[/b][/color]<br /><br />
