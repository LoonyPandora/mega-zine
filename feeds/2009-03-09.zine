Except for Will 3, but he went to college so he doesn't count. God, why did I ever date him? Asthma! Ew! Anyway... you didn't even send me a text to tell me! How do you think that makes me feel, WLW? Me! It's all about *me*! I'll have to dump Ben 4 now to get over it (I was thinking about it, anyway - he plays the violin. Loser.)

The upbeat music belies the dark contents of the lyric, with its undertones of lost love and bereavement. Not since the Bonzos allusion to "sweet essence of giraffe" has the ungulate been recognised in song. This reference is appropriate testimony to the leggy one's longevity. If you change some letters in "Paper Truth" it's an anagram of Tommy Cooper. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]*Forwards a copy to John Earls*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Etc, etc.|We invented a cat puninator machine to make lots of cat puns for Mega-Zine and... other purposes, but we are really worried it is broken because lots of the puns are really paw, and lots of them are quite a meowth-ful too. We're not telling tall tails, it is such purrfect fun! It is the cat's pyjamas, with the cats, and the punnage, and the HOYVIN-GLAYVIN!

Awkward, unwanted, uncomfortable and full of thoughts on how things could get so bad. They have though. And she says there won't be another series of Hetty Wainthrop Investigates. Bye 'Zine. I'd lick your tears WLW, but I don't think I could reach.

So I'm going to be a psychic.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Rose Timp[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Cue "should've seen that coming" jokes.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
