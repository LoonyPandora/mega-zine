WLW has gone on holiday again, although thanks to the economy, it's Margate rather than Spain this year. As today's replacement editor (for which read: unpaid labourer), I will strive to be as funny as our long-necked mentor, or at least more entertaining than the Teletext Advent Calendar (a tough target, I know). So without further ado, let's see what you lot have been sending in...<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Word!|I'm so sad, and here is why: I wrote to you, but you never replied. I used that new post box, y'know, black and wide, on a lamp-post outside, Parcel Force Worldwide. The one that says "Litter", but now I feel bitter, so "brb", I'm gonna drink glitter (Cue Dido sample).<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante MaelStan[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Listen up friend, post boxes are red, and if you've letters to send, it's to these you must head; so heed what I say, and hopefully this'll, reduce the delay of your next epistle.

Ho ho!|Helping Peaches Geldof and Bananarama babysit Apple Martin, a thought occurred to me.
