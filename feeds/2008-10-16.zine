It's too intelligent for most people. It incorporates so many things I love. Dylan, Cohen. Neil Young. Angry blind dogs. Drugs and booze. Did I mention transvestites? Literature. And some stunning acting. No giraffes though. Shame. Can't win 'em all.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Mondo[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Michael Douglas's saggy buttocks are not welcome at WLW Towers.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

You can't trust anyone these days, some people would steal the beard off Brian Blessed's face. Still, I see no one took any of Victoria's CDs, I take it even he had standards (if this joke appears on the News Quiz, I get paid fifty quid so print it).<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Mabel's pleased as punch - she picked up a PVC catsuit dirt cheap.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
