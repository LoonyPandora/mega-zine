I take solace that this is probably their attempt to subtly let me know that they're actually quite bitter at the fact I have such a great hobby but, mainly, the vinegar is just annoying. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Topper[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Bill Oddie - closet 'Ziner.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

And afterwards.|Someone once asked me, "What does it take to become a Colonial Foot Soldier like you?". I smiled. I then proceeded to buy an ice-cream and swallow it whole. No brain freeze. No sensitive teeth. No choking because I forgot to remove the lollipop stick. I said "That's wha... wait, hey where'd you go?". He'd left. Doesn't have what it takes I guess. My tummy hurts. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Someone rub it better will you? Wash hands first. And afterwards.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
