Yawwwnnnnn. *stretches languidly* Are we done now?|WLW, Friend of the 18th Century, Sarah... sadly, you are both wrong. The word is actually Aztec in origin. I know! Its modern form was derived from Octopodixl, the eight-armed Aztec god of blood and hope. He used to eat all their fears and help their wishes. Keep that one. Your friends will be fascinated.
