Not because of perfectly sane reasons such as the fact he follows me everywhere, he's harder to see in the dark, he mocks my every move, depending where the sun is he might become 72 feet tall etc. No, I'm afraid of him because he dances to YMCA even when I don't. I'm still trying to see if he has a moustache too. I'd rock a moustache! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Hopes it's a handlebar*[/b][/color]<br /><br />
