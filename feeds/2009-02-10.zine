Your thoughts and beliefs and ideas and ideologies make lots of notes and patterns, but your anger and mean thoughts about people make broken notes and discords. They are horrible! All the notes mix together to make your music. Everyone's piece of music is different and beautiful and special, but you are not allowed to hear it until you die. Obviously.

The whole power ballad is so 1988, and forgetting the lyrics and gibbering is so karaoke. If she wants to win, we could blood eagle that shouting woman who was compering last year.
