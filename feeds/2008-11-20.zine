Anyway, Mondo is, of course, my showbiz name. My real name is so boring and mundane. Oh all right; it's Dirk Stardust. But don't tell anyone.<br />[color=#0000ff][b]How dull.

One example is that, after inventing the "sentence" back in 1988, I found out that many people had been talking in them for at least 3/4 years, right back before I was even born! Sometimes, I hear people talk in sentences and it's like a sentence shaped dagger in my solar-plexus.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Topper[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It's a syn..... tax.

It attracted noticeable attention, mainly under shiny lights in markets. After, Neil Diamond and Jordan enjoyed wild hare and veal in nut gravy. "Please read everything" muttered Andy Richter, indignantly, "Take a look, Santa's eating xerobates!" <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]A word in your shell-like...[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

I got hollered at, I got stared at, I got laughed at, I got mocked. I got things thrown, I got sneers shown, felt all alone, I felt shocked. I ran. Far, far away from the streets and houses, I knew I should've worn my lucky trousers. Or, at least, y'know, trousers. <br /><br /> [color=#ff0000][i]Reeling Twicewards Heysid[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]It's been one of those 'Zines, don't you think?[/b][/color]<br /><br />
