If I could be bothered, I would stage a coup and take over forever. I reckon a leopard could take a giraffe. However, I have better things to do, for example sitting in bed all day refreshing Facebook.<br /><br /> So, here is my one and only personal 'Zine. I hope you enjoy it more than you would a David Tennant loveslave dipped in chocolate.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Lilac Leopard[/i][/color]<br /><br />

WORD! I'm cool. This "December" thing is strange. A period called "month" to distinguish from arms, beef, etc. Which sick slice of stupid invented the idea? Those poor others it spells disaster for; people I won't meet, for, as me, they are at home with pizza, some shackled hut: we must bring them a flame of hope, throwing lifeline devices at last.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Vigilante Of The Maelstrom[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Ten times 94, cast a spell, time says things which don't properly amuse many.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Could you spare just &#163;25 a day?|For my new year resolution, I have decided that I will eat healthily, exercise regularly, and give to charity. Although, if I give to charity, I won't be able to afford the gym or healthy food. Well that decides it, I'll stay at home with my money and do nothing. Happy New Year all!<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Colonial Foot Soldier[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]But then who will care for a Leopard like me?
