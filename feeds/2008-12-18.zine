WLW, poke your head up the chimney and keep a look out for Santa. Do you know what a christingle is? It's a candle stuck in an orange; it represents Jesus's light in the world. So now you know what to do with the old orange in your stocking (which your parents bought you in October).<br />Well, have a really great time, everybody.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Squashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br /><br /><br />

Problem solved.|For my new year's resolution, I have decided that I will eat healthily, exercise regularly, and give to charity. Although, if I give to charity, I won't be able to afford the gym or healthy food. Well that decides it, I'll stay at home with my money and do nothing. Happy New Year all!

Have a nice Christmas, wrap up warm.|My mum asked for chocolates, my sister wanted a horror novel, and my dad wanted some kind of Russian space station. So I asked these three wise men I met what I should do, and they were really helpful. I ended up buying All Gold, Frankenstein and Mir. Ba-dum-dum-tsch? No? Suit yourself. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Insane Jam Sow[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]No, No, Jammy. That was very good. Although I'm a bit worried about you talking to strange men.
