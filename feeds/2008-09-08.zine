It's not. Unfortunately, now we'll have weeks of "celeb" interviews with the inevitable romances all over the front pages of magazines.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Tooth Of Wisdom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> <br />[color=#0000ff][b]Thanks for that...[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />

It's the advert song awards.
