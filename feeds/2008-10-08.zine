I have yet to verify this, but shall be avidly looking out for it in future. What a great tribute such an epitaph would be to any man. I hope I am one day remembered with such fondness.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Psychedelic Gloom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I just hope when I go, Pat Butcher will be there to mourn me too.[/b][/color]<br /><br /><br />
