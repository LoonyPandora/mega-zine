Name-dropping our EVA units is he? They only obey PP and I, and self-destruct otherwise. On a different note, WLW, I need a bodyguard. Glasgow's drunken underworld is scary for a girl of my small stature. Nights watching horror movies in bars is no fun when fugly drunks come onto you. Anyone help a wee angel who's given up her sword until after Xmas so she gets more presents?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]One Winged Angel[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]OWA-Fan's a contender.

Just make sure you&#39;re home in time for Hollyoaks, will you?|Well the EVAs object to being Divas. Just because they are such fantastic dancers we got Vash The Stampede to go on about "Love And Peace" and Kuroneko Sama (Lord Black Cat) just frightened them by staring at them. Now me and OWA are just procuring the Knightmare frames to launch a mass attack on Paris and overrated French cooking.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Princess Psycho[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]As you wish.

She was always so nice to us, she made chicken and sweetcorn soup for us when we had the flu, then there was the pancakes. We liked her pancakes. Still, she can be very scary. She punched a dog out for barking at her, but the song was about staring elves, not goblins.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Viking Horde[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Tsk.
