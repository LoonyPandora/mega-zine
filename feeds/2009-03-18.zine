It's hard to believe I've been writing in for five years, mostly because I've barely wrote in in that time, and most of what I did was unfunny. Ah well, maybe something better will come along, eh?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Haryuu No Hanekata[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]Well, "unfunny" never stopped me either.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Either that or start a highly profitable merchandise option. So, OWA can take the right hand side and I'll take the left, while Mondo goes down the centre with the Bullseye suit and the tactical nuke strapped to him. They'll never take him alive.

It was Insane Jam Sow who first mentioned giraffes, 'Zine has made me smile and laugh. I think Banana Flavoured Lemon has a pretty name, I'm proud to be a 'Ziner, I'm not ashamed. 'Ziners give me joy, especially Rude Boy. WLW is witty and not at all thick, and as lovely as Nashreem the magical rain stick.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Smashed Strawberry, Hector's House[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]There from the start - I salute you.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Having created a place to muse the minutiae and fete the frivolous, we find the Earth has moved and 'Zine is no more. There'll be no more bandwagons or buzzwords, newbies or name dropping, but with a daiquiri in one hoof and a tin of pilchards in the other, I set forth with the knowledge that we all are the better for 'Zine. Friends, farewell.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]WLW[/i][/color]<br /><br />
