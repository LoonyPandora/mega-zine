Some of the noises I heard included "goock", "tss-aahhh", "eeeyguf" and "I demolished a big chicken last night hey. Went down like easy like Yurma". He may have said Burma, that would make more sense.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Shamrocking Bogman[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]There's nothing like seeing the 'Zine on the big screen at the pub...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

Not since that drunken night of shame back in &#39;98.|Is that barfly implying that they don't see a trunk when they look down at their body? How odd. I hope I am a tree as WLW has been known to sneak a quick nibble at my canopy and we're otherwise incompatible. Cheers! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]The Barking Tree[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I haven't nibbled canopy in years TBT.

She showed me the packet from the meal she was cooking and the instructions stated: "Cook on full power for 9 minutes, stand for 2 minutes."<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Jaggy Thistle[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]I'll wager, good sir, that no such friend exists.[/b][/color]<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

But, having failed in my quest for the legendary Teletext T-shirt, how am I going to prove to the university arbiters that I am me when I go for interview? My acceptance could rest on whether they believe I edited Teletext! Take that, collective conscience of the 'Zine! <br />[color=#ff0000][i]FightingTorque[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]It's not exactly a door opener.[/b][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Trust me.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
