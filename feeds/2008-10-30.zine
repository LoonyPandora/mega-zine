Oh.|After noting the Hallow-Zine spooktacular, I thought it about time to make my return. Why was Daddypoos arrested on October 31? His ghoulies were hanging out. Not really, but the thought of him being incarcerated makes me laugh at least. [color=#ff0000][i]Seren Arian[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]At least they only come out onc-...
