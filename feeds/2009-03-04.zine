I've managed to rope in Mark Moraghan as a big hitter. You know that guy from Brookside who had an affair with Susannah? Greg, was it? If he's not A-list enough, then I've got a mate who is Kim Wilde's third cousin. When I rang Hello! it certainly wasn't a hello that they greeted me with mind, WLW. Can you have a quick word?<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Junior Minister[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Take A Break called - they have a half of page 52 free if we want it.[/b][/color]<br /><br />

A sea monster to find fan club addresses for you all?|Further to my previous post, maybe 'Zine could be replaced by 21st century versions of past favourites. How about Bark(ing tree) Avenue, or Debbles' Diary? If not, maybe Karen H could bring back her rather racy problem page, so much better than the old "Angst".<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Saint David[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]What next?

The whole world is in uproar, seemingly as an instantaneous response to the end of our precious 'Zine.  I thought I'd saved us before, but I think I just delayed it. New plan. Save WLW, save the world. Oh, and I've always thought of myself more Hiro Nakamura than Locke, despite being born in the same town as Sniggledywingwong.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Griffplar Of Doom[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Dusts off cheerleader costume*[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I've been here for years under various names, and I loved it. When things got me down 'Zine made me smile, I felt like the people here understood the utter nonsense I put forth. Most importantly I met One Winged Angel, my beloved Debbles, who I hope is always there for me to annoy. Goodbye WLW, you big galut you.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Marmaduke Twist[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]OWA - always there for you? Now that is utter nonsense.[/b][/color]<br /><br />
