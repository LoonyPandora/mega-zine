Farewell old friend. <br />[color=#ff0000][i]Paddy Irishman[/i][/color]<br />[color=#0000ff][b]Right back at ya. [/b][/color]<br /><br />

Basically, someone aaaaages ago, decided it'd be good to carve lots of naked women with, quite frankly, large appendages. They've been called the Upper Palaeolithic version of Playboy. Palaeoboy if you will. Anyhow, I thought I'd educate you all a bit, in case you got really bored and stuff.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Elden Ray[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]*Googles* Reminds me of that time Mabel forgot to lock the bathroom door...[/b][/color]<br /><br />

I returned from a two-year mission, travelling the world, saving endangered species. I even discovered two new ones. In Central Africa I found a Lesser Spotted Leopard and a Solar Bear.

It was foretold in the good book (Kama Sutra, That was a good book) that the blessed giraffe would be taken from us to the land of Gran Can and would there live a life of debauchery with fair maidens. Whilst we are left to drink ourselves silly... On second thoughts, it has its merits.<br />[color=#ff0000][i]Daddypoos, Wigan (Long John Silver-Plated)[/i][/color]<br /><br /> [color=#0000ff][b]"Fair maidens"?[/b][/color]<br /><br />
