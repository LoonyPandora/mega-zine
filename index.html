                        <p><span class="author">The Wonginator</span> I'm writing in for the first time to say, the pleasure's been all mine, and that I hereby name this the day, the day of the Mega-Zine.</p>

                        <p>So, this is the last letter I'll be sending, for obvious reasons. It's hard to believe I've been writing in for five years, mostly because I've barely wrote in in that time, and most of what I did was unfunny. Ah well, maybe something better will come along, eh?</p>

                        <p>If you're seeing Mondo in the dunes you will have no need of the fair maidens. Still, it takes all sorts. It's as well he can't now tell tales. Perhaps at the reunion, eh?
    Anyway, for the last time, Bon Voyage.</p>

                        <h3>The last word</h3>
                        <p>How to sum up 16 years of 'Zine... of nothing much, or much of nothing? Much the same really. Having created a place to muse the minutiae and fete the frivolous, we find the Earth has moved and 'Zine is no more. There'll be no more bandwagons or buzzwords, newbies or name dropping, but with a daiquiri in one hoof and a tin of pilchards in the other, I set forth with the knowledge that we all are the better for 'Zine. Friends, farewell.
